# Google Calendar Tools

Enhance Google Calendar with powerful productivity tools: duplicate events, copy entire days, batch operations, and quick duration adjustments.

## Features

- **Duplicate Events**: Quick "Duplicate to Tomorrow" button for any event
- **Copy Day**: Copy all events from one day to another with conflict resolution
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and copy multiple events at once
- **Quick Duration Controls**: Adjust event duration with +/-15 min buttons
- **Seamless Integration**: UI elements that blend naturally with Google Calendar

## Google Calendar API Setup

To use the bulk operations and API-powered features, you need to configure Google Calendar API access:

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google Calendar API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API" 
   - Click "Enable"

### 2. OAuth2 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Configure OAuth consent screen (if prompted):
   - Set application name: "Google Calendar Tools"
   - Add your email as test user
   - Add scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID:
   - Application type: **Chrome Extension**
   - Name: "Google Calendar Tools Extension"
   - Copy the generated **Client ID**

### 3. Extension Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual Client ID:
   ```bash
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```
3. Rebuild the extension: `npm run build`

> **Note**: The `.env` file is excluded from version control for security. Never commit your actual OAuth2 credentials to the repository.

### 4. Extension ID Setup

After loading the extension in Chrome:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your extension and copy its **Extension ID**
3. Return to Google Cloud Console > Credentials
4. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add:
   ```
   chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID
   ```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development build with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Load the extension in Chrome:
# 1. Go to chrome://extensions/
# 2. Enable "Developer mode"
# 3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the 'build' folder
```

## Architecture
