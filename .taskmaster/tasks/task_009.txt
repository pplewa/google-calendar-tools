# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Robust Error Handling and Resilience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the extension handles errors gracefully and remains functional despite Google Calendar DOM changes.
# Details:
Implement error boundaries and fallback mechanisms. Use MutationObserver to detect and adapt to DOM changes. Log errors to the background script for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Test that the extension recovers from errors and adapts to DOM changes without breaking.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and integrate error boundaries to catch and handle exceptions within component trees, preventing application crashes and isolating failures.
### Details:
Use constructs like try-catch blocks or framework-specific error boundary components (e.g., React Error Boundaries) to capture errors in child components and prevent them from propagating to the entire application. Ensure boundaries are placed strategically to maximize coverage without excessive granularity.[3]

## 2. Add Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design and implement fallback UI or workflows to maintain usability when errors occur or data is unavailable.
### Details:
Provide user-friendly fallback content or alternative flows, such as cached data, default values, or error-specific UI, to ensure a seamless user experience even during failures. Avoid generic error messages and offer actionable suggestions where possible.[1][3]

## 3. Adapt to DOM Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Ensure the application can detect and respond to unpredictable changes in the DOM, maintaining stability and resilience.
### Details:
Implement defensive programming techniques to monitor and adapt to dynamic DOM updates, such as using mutation observers or robust selectors. Ensure error boundaries and fallback mechanisms remain effective even as the DOM structure evolves.

## 4. Log Errors [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Set up comprehensive error logging to capture, store, and analyze error events for debugging and monitoring.
### Details:
Integrate logging solutions to record error messages, stack traces, timestamps, and user context. Consider using third-party error tracking services for aggregation and alerting. Ensure logs are accessible for ongoing analysis and improvement.[1][3]

## 5. Test Recovery Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Develop and execute tests that simulate various error and recovery scenarios to validate the application's resilience and error handling.
### Details:
Create automated and manual tests to trigger error boundaries, fallback mechanisms, and DOM changes. Verify that errors are logged, users receive appropriate feedback, and the application recovers gracefully without data loss or crashes.[3][4]
