# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive User Feedback for Bulk Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time progress indicators, operation status updates, batch processing feedback, and error reporting for bulk copying operations with progress bars, estimated time remaining, and detailed results summaries.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive user feedback system to replace the current slow and opaque bulk operation process. Key implementation steps:

1. **Progress Indicator Components**: Create reusable progress bar components with percentage completion, estimated time remaining, and current operation status. Use CSS animations for smooth progress updates and implement a circular progress indicator for compact spaces.

2. **Real-time Status Updates**: Establish a message passing system between background script and content script to provide live updates during bulk operations. Display current operation (e.g., "Copying event 45 of 200"), successful/failed counts, and operation phase (authentication, fetching, processing, creating).

3. **Batch Processing Feedback**: Implement granular feedback for batch operations showing individual batch progress, retry attempts for failed batches, and detailed error categorization (API limits, network issues, permission errors). Display batch size optimization and processing speed metrics.

4. **Error Reporting and Recovery**: Create a comprehensive error reporting system with categorized error messages, suggested actions for resolution, and automatic retry mechanisms. Implement error aggregation to show summary of all errors encountered during bulk operations.

5. **Results Summary Modal**: Design a detailed results modal showing operation completion summary, total events processed, success/failure breakdown, time taken, and actionable next steps. Include export functionality for error logs and operation reports.

6. **Performance Metrics**: Track and display operation performance metrics including events per second, API call efficiency, and comparison with previous operations to help users understand processing speed improvements.

7. **User Control Features**: Add pause/resume functionality for long-running operations, cancel operation capability with cleanup, and priority adjustment for different operation types.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing approach: 1) Test progress indicators by running bulk copy operations of varying sizes (10, 100, 500+ events) and verify accurate progress percentage, time estimates, and status updates throughout the process, 2) Simulate network interruptions and API failures during bulk operations to verify error reporting accuracy and recovery mechanisms, 3) Test batch processing feedback by monitoring operations with multiple batches and confirming individual batch progress and retry logic, 4) Verify results summary accuracy by comparing displayed metrics with actual operation outcomes across different scenarios (all success, partial failures, complete failures), 5) Test user control features by pausing/resuming operations mid-process and canceling operations to ensure proper cleanup, 6) Performance test the feedback system itself to ensure progress updates don't significantly impact bulk operation speed, 7) Test feedback system across different calendar views and screen sizes to ensure responsive design and visibility.
