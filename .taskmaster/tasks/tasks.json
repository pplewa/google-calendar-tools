The system now features a research-based time parsing engine that recognizes multiple Google Calendar time patterns including all-day events, multi-day timed events, single-day with date, simple time ranges, 24-hour format, and single time entries with default durations. Advanced date/time parsing utilities handle various formats with robust fallback mechanisms. The enhanced EventDetails interface captures complete event information including ID, title, start/end DateTime objects, all-day flags, location, and description. An intelligent extraction pipeline combines popover text analysis with pattern priority matching and context-aware processing. The system includes comprehensive error recovery for locale support, missing data handling, multiple dash separators, and whitespace tolerance. Technical implementation emphasizes memory efficiency, type safety with full TypeScript typing, performance optimization, and detailed logging. All event types are now supported for cloning including all-day events with proper date ranges, timed events with precise timestamps, multi-day spanning events, events with location/description metadata, and international time formats supporting both 12-hour and 24-hour conventions.\n</info added on 2025-07-05T08:53:25.696Z>",
