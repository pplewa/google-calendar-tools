The system now features a research-based time parsing engine that recognizes multiple Google Calendar time patterns including all-day events, multi-day timed events, single-day with date, simple time ranges, 24-hour format, and single time entries with default durations. Advanced date/time parsing utilities handle various formats with robust fallback mechanisms. The enhanced EventDetails interface captures complete event information including ID, title, start/end DateTime objects, all-day flags, location, and description. An intelligent extraction pipeline combines popover text analysis with pattern priority matching and context-aware processing. The system includes comprehensive error recovery for locale support, missing data handling, multiple dash separators, and whitespace tolerance. Technical implementation emphasizes memory efficiency, type safety with full TypeScript typing, performance optimization, and detailed logging. All event types are now supported for cloning including all-day events with proper date ranges, timed events with precise timestamps, multi-day spanning events, events with location/description metadata, and international time formats supporting both 12-hour and 24-hour conventions.\n</info added on 2025-07-05T08:53:25.696Z>",

The original implementation set all-day event end dates to 23:59:59 of the same day, which violated Google Calendar API standards and caused events to be copied to wrong dates. The comprehensive fix included: 1) Corrected All-Day Event Handling - all-day events now properly calculate end dates as start of next day following Google Calendar API standards, 2) Multi-Day Event Support - added duration calculation for multi-day all-day events, 3) API Compliance - end dates set to startDate + durationDays with proper hour boundaries (0:00:00), 4) Enhanced Logging - fixed misleading log messages for better debugging. The bug manifested when copying all-day events to different dates, where DOM-based copying used incorrect date boundaries causing API rejection and fallback to wrong dates. The new API-based approach with corrected date handling ensures events appear on intended target dates. Extension has been tested and is building successfully.",

API Availability Testing:**\n```typescript\n// Test API availability by attempting to get auth token\ntry {\n  await this.sendMessageToBackground({ type: 'AUTH_TOKEN', interactive: false });\n  this.log('📡 API available - using fast API-based approach');\n  // Use API methods...\n} catch (apiError) {\n  this.log('⚠️ API unavailable - falling back to DOM scraping');\n  // Use DOM methods...\n}\n```\n\n**2. Automatic Detection and Switching:**\n- Tests API availability by attempting non-interactive token retrieval\n- On API success: Uses `collectEventsFromDayAPI()` and `copyEventsToTargetDayAPI()`\n- On API failure: Automatically falls back to `collectEventsFromDay()` and `copyEventsToTargetDay()`\n- Provides clear logging of which approach is being used\n\n**3. Comprehensive Error Handling:**\n- Handles OAuth denial gracefully without user interruption\n- Manages token expiration by reverting to DOM approach\n- Recovers from API quota exhaustion seamlessly\n- Maintains full functionality regardless of API status\n\n**4. User Notification System:**\n- Shows appropriate notifications for both API and DOM approaches\n- Clear messaging about which method is being used\n- Progress indicators adapt to the selected approach\n- Error messages specific to the active method\n\n**5. Seamless Operation Continuity:**\n- All features work identically in both modes\n- No functionality loss during API failures\n- Background-foreground approach maintains UI responsiveness\n- Legacy DOM methods remain fully operational\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\nThe fallback mechanism is implemented as a try-catch wrapper around API operations in `handleCopyDay()`.

        "details": "Implement a lightweight DOM-based event extraction system as a fallback mechanism when the Google Calendar API is unavailable or fails. Key implementation steps:\n\n1. **Direct DOM Event Extraction**: Create selectors to extract visible event data directly from calendar grid elements without triggering popover interactions. Target data includes: event title (from card text), time information (from time labels), basic visual indicators (color, calendar assignment), and event duration (calculated from card positioning).\n\n2. **Efficient Data Parsing**: Implement parsing logic to extract structured data from DOM elements using CSS selectors and text parsing. Handle different calendar views (month, week, day) with view-specific extraction strategies. Use caching to avoid re-parsing unchanged DOM elements.\n\n3. **Minimal Popover Strategy**: For critical missing data that cannot be extracted from visible elements, implement a selective popover opening mechanism that only opens popovers when absolutely necessary (e.g., for detailed descriptions or attendee information). Batch popover requests to minimize performance impact.\n\n4. **Fallback Detection Logic**: Create a detection system that determines when to use DOM extraction vs API calls. Monitor API availability, rate limits, and authentication status. Automatically switch to DOM extraction when API calls fail or are unavailable.\n\n5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement debouncing for DOM changes, use DocumentFragment for efficient DOM manipulation, and employ lazy loading for non-critical data. Cache extracted data with invalidation strategies based on DOM mutations.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for malformed DOM structures, missing elements, and parsing failures.

Key implementation steps:\n\n1. **Background Script Setup**: Create a dedicated background script (background.js) with service worker architecture for Manifest V3 compatibility. Register message listeners for bulk operation requests and implement proper lifecycle management.\n\n2. **Message Passing System**: Establish bidirectional communication between content script (UI) and background script using Chrome's runtime.sendMessage and runtime.onMessage APIs. Define message schemas for different operation types (BULK_COPY, BULK_DELETE, PROGRESS_UPDATE, ERROR_REPORT, OPERATION_COMPLETE).\n\n3. **Operation Queue Management**: Implement a queue system in the background script to handle multiple concurrent bulk operations. Use a priority-based queue with operation types, timestamps, and user context to manage execution order.\n\n4. **Progress Tracking Infrastructure**: Create a progress tracking system that reports completion percentages, processed item counts, and estimated time remaining. Implement progress callbacks that send updates to the UI every 100ms or after processing batches of 10 events.\n\n5. **State Synchronization**: Maintain operation state across content script reloads and tab switches. Store operation progress in chrome.storage.local and implement state recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations.\n\n6. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Implement comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff retry logic for API failures. Categorize errors (network, authentication, rate limiting, validation) and implement appropriate recovery strategies.\n\n7. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent rate limiting to respect Google Calendar API quotas (10,000 requests per 100 seconds per user). Use token bucket algorithm with dynamic adjustment based on API response headers.\n\n8. **Memory Management**: Implement efficient memory usage patterns for large datasets, processing events in chunks of 100-200 items to prevent memory exhaustion during bulk operations.\n\nExample message structure:\n```typescript\ninterface BulkOperationMessage {\n  type: 'BULK_COPY' | 'PROGRESS_UPDATE' | 'OPERATION_COMPLETE';\n  operationId: string;\n  data: {\n    events?: CalendarEvent[];\n    progress?: { completed: number; total: number; percentage: number };\n    error?: { code: string; message: string; retryable: boolean };\n  };\n}\n```",
