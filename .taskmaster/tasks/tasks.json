The system now features a research-based time parsing engine that recognizes multiple Google Calendar time patterns including all-day events, multi-day timed events, single-day with date, simple time ranges, 24-hour format, and single time entries with default durations. Advanced date/time parsing utilities handle various formats with robust fallback mechanisms. The enhanced EventDetails interface captures complete event information including ID, title, start/end DateTime objects, all-day flags, location, and description. An intelligent extraction pipeline combines popover text analysis with pattern priority matching and context-aware processing. The system includes comprehensive error recovery for locale support, missing data handling, multiple dash separators, and whitespace tolerance. Technical implementation emphasizes memory efficiency, type safety with full TypeScript typing, performance optimization, and detailed logging. All event types are now supported for cloning including all-day events with proper date ranges, timed events with precise timestamps, multi-day spanning events, events with location/description metadata, and international time formats supporting both 12-hour and 24-hour conventions.\n</info added on 2025-07-05T08:53:25.696Z>",

Root cause analysis revealed that the bug was caused by incorrect all-day event date handling in the adjustEventForNewDate() method. The original implementation set all-day event end dates to 23:59:59 of the same day, which violated Google Calendar API standards and caused events to be copied to wrong dates. The comprehensive fix included: 1) Corrected All-Day Event Handling - all-day events now properly calculate end dates as start of next day following Google Calendar API standards, 2) Multi-Day Event Support - added duration calculation for multi-day all-day events, 3) API Compliance - end dates set to startDate + durationDays with proper hour boundaries (0:00:00), 4) Enhanced Logging - fixed misleading log messages for better debugging. The bug manifested when copying all-day events to different dates, where DOM-based copying used incorrect date boundaries causing API rejection and fallback to wrong dates. The new API-based approach with corrected date handling ensures events appear on intended target dates. Extension has been tested and is building successfully.",

        "details": "Implement a robust background script architecture to handle computationally intensive operations and maintain UI responsiveness during bulk operations. Key implementation steps:\n\n1. **Background Script Setup**: Create a dedicated background script (background.js) with service worker architecture for Manifest V3 compatibility. Register message listeners for bulk operation requests and implement proper lifecycle management.\n\n2. **Message Passing System**: Establish bidirectional communication between content script (UI) and background script using Chrome's runtime.sendMessage and runtime.onMessage APIs. Define message schemas for different operation types (BULK_COPY, BULK_DELETE, PROGRESS_UPDATE, ERROR_REPORT, OPERATION_COMPLETE).\n\n3. **Operation Queue Management**: Implement a queue system in the background script to handle multiple concurrent bulk operations. Use a priority-based queue with operation types, timestamps, and user context to manage execution order.\n\n4. **Progress Tracking Infrastructure**: Create a progress tracking system that reports completion percentages, processed item counts, and estimated time remaining. Implement progress callbacks that send updates to the UI every 100ms or after processing batches of 10 events.\n\n5. **State Synchronization**: Maintain operation state across content script reloads and tab switches. Store operation progress in chrome.storage.local and implement state recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations.\n\n6. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Implement comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff retry logic for API failures. Categorize errors (network, authentication, rate limiting, validation) and implement appropriate recovery strategies.\n\n7. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent rate limiting to respect Google Calendar API quotas (10,000 requests per 100 seconds per user). Use token bucket algorithm with dynamic adjustment based on API response headers.\n\n8. **Memory Management**: Implement efficient memory usage patterns for large datasets, processing events in chunks of 100-200 items to prevent memory exhaustion during bulk operations.\n\nExample message structure:\n```typescript\ninterface BulkOperationMessage {\n  type: 'BULK_COPY' | 'PROGRESS_UPDATE' | 'OPERATION_COMPLETE';\n  operationId: string;\n  data: {\n    events?: CalendarEvent[];\n    progress?: { completed: number; total: number; percentage: number };\n    error?: { code: string; message: string; retryable: boolean };\n  };\n}\n```",

Implemented dynamic token bucket algorithm with real-time rate adjustment based on API feedback and error patterns. Token bucket capacity automatically adjusts based on current rate (10 seconds worth of requests) with 30-second adjustment intervals. Added intelligent rate adjustment logic with aggressive backoff (50% reduction) for rate limit errors and gradual recovery (10% increase) for 95%+ success rates. Implemented API response header analysis for Google Calendar API headers (X-RateLimit-*, Retry-After) with automatic conservative adjustment when quota usage exceeds 80%. Added comprehensive analytics tracking requests per window, rate limit hits, response times, and success rates using exponential moving average calculations. Integrated rate limiting analytics with existing error classification system. Updated apiRequestWithRetry() and batchRequestWithRetry() methods to track request timing and automatically update rate limit analytics.

Modern UI patterns should include real-time progress indicators with actionable controls, immediate status feedback via toast notifications, confirmation dialogs for destructive actions, and detailed results summaries. Architecture requires robust background/content script communication with persistent state in extension storage for crash recovery and background script handling with responsive UI threads. Implementation plan: enhanced state machine in background script with safe transitions, pause/resume/cancel buttons with priority adjustment in UI controls, persistent storage with recovery mechanisms for state management, and comprehensive cleanup with user feedback for error handling.\n</info added on 2025-07-08T08:02:03.326Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-08T08:08:02.816Z>\nIMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: User Control Features for Bulk Operations\n\nCore Functionality Delivered:\n\nAdvanced Operation Controls - Pause/Resume/Cancel with full state machine support and atomic transitions, Priority Adjustment with dynamic queue reordering and immediate visual feedback, Immediate UI Response using optimistic updates plus background sync for responsive interactions, Safe Cancellation with confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental operation termination.\n\nState Management Implementation - Enhanced Background Message Types added OPERATION_PAUSE, OPERATION_RESUME, PRIORITY_ADJUST support, Comprehensive Control Handler with handleOperationControl() providing atomic state transitions and resource cleanup, Advanced Recovery featuring state checkpointing, stale detection, and intelligent cleanup procedures, Real-time Sync enabling bidirectional communication between content script and background operations.\n\nModern UI Controls following 2024 Best Practices - Action-Specific Buttons with context-aware controls including pause/resume toggles and cancel with confirmation, Priority Dropdowns for instant priority adjustment of queued operations with visual feedback, Progress Indicators showing real-time remaining time estimates with smooth animations, Confirmation Dialogs using modal confirmation for destructive actions with escape key support.\n\nMessage Flow Architecture follows pattern: Content Script Control → Background Handler → Operation State Machine → State Broadcast → UI Update.\n\nSafety Features include Confirmation for Cancel using modal dialog to prevent accidental cancellations, Idempotent Operations safe to retry control commands without side effects, State Validation ensuring operations can only be controlled in appropriate states, Resource Cleanup with automatic cleanup on cancellation and memory management.\n\nPerformance and UX optimizations provide Immediate Feedback with visual indicators appearing instantly on button press, Background Processing for state changes processed async with user notifications, Toast Notifications for success/error feedback with 4-second auto-dismiss, Responsive Design where controls adapt to operation state (active/paused/queued).\n\nTechnical Implementation Details: renderOperationControls() for dynamic control generation based on operation state, attachOperationControlListeners() using event delegation for all control interactions, handleOperationControl() as central control dispatcher with error handling, showCancelConfirmation() providing accessible confirmation dialog with keyboard support, updateLocalOperationState() for optimistic UI updates ensuring immediate responsiveness.\n\nThis implementation provides production-ready operation management with enterprise-grade reliability and modern UX patterns.

        "details": "Configure Google OAuth2 credentials to enable the fast API-based Copy Day functionality that is currently falling back to slow DOM scraping due to placeholder OAuth2 client ID in the manifest. Implementation steps:\n\n1. **Google Cloud Console Setup**: Create a new Google Cloud Console project or use existing one. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials section. Enable the Google Calendar API in the API Library (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com).\n\n2. **OAuth2 Credentials Creation**: Create OAuth2 client ID credentials for Chrome Extension application type. Configure authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs. Set up OAuth consent screen with required scopes (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events). Add test users if in testing mode.\n\n3. **Manifest Configuration**: Update manifest.json to replace placeholder OAuth2 client ID with the real client ID from Google Cloud Console. Ensure proper permissions are set for calendar.google.com and googleapis.com domains. Configure oauth2 section with correct client_id and scopes.\n\n4. **Authentication Flow Implementation**: Verify the existing OAuth2 authentication flow works with real credentials. Test token acquisition, refresh, and storage mechanisms. Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures and expired tokens.\n\n5. **API Integration Verification**: Confirm that the Google Calendar API integration (Task 13) now uses the fast API calls instead of falling back to DOM scraping. Verify batch operations work correctly with authenticated requests.\n\n6. **Security Considerations**: Implement proper credential storage and handling. Ensure client secrets are not exposed in the extension code. Configure appropriate OAuth scopes with minimal required permissions.",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing approach: 1) Verify Google Cloud Console project setup by confirming Calendar API is enabled and OAuth2 credentials are properly configured with correct application type and authorized domains, 2) Test OAuth2 authentication flow by installing the extension and confirming successful Google account authentication without errors, 3) Validate API functionality by performing Copy Day operations and confirming they use fast API calls instead of DOM scraping fallback (monitor network requests to verify googleapis.com calls), 4) Test bulk operations with 100+ events to ensure API rate limits and batch processing work correctly with real credentials, 5) Verify token refresh mechanism by testing extension functionality after token expiration, 6) Test error handling by temporarily disabling API access and confirming graceful fallback behavior, 7) Validate OAuth consent screen displays correctly with proper app name, scopes, and privacy policy information.",
