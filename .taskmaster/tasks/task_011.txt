# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix Copy Day Target Date Bug
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: ✅ RESOLVED: This bug has been fixed as part of Task 13.2 (API Integration). The target date bug was caused by incorrect all-day event date handling in the adjustEventForNewDate() method, where all-day events had end dates set to 23:59:59 of the same day, violating Google Calendar API standards. The fix implemented proper all-day event handling with end dates calculated as start of next day, multi-day event support with duration calculation, and API compliance with correct hour boundaries.
# Details:
✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: The Copy Day target date bug has been successfully fixed through Task 13.2 API Integration. Root cause analysis revealed that the bug was caused by incorrect all-day event date handling in the adjustEventForNewDate() method. The original implementation set all-day event end dates to 23:59:59 of the same day, which violated Google Calendar API standards and caused events to be copied to wrong dates. The comprehensive fix included: 1) Corrected All-Day Event Handling - all-day events now properly calculate end dates as start of next day following Google Calendar API standards, 2) Multi-Day Event Support - added duration calculation for multi-day all-day events, 3) API Compliance - end dates set to startDate + durationDays with proper hour boundaries (0:00:00), 4) Enhanced Logging - fixed misleading log messages for better debugging. The bug manifested when copying all-day events to different dates, where DOM-based copying used incorrect date boundaries causing API rejection and fallback to wrong dates. The new API-based approach with corrected date handling ensures events appear on intended target dates. Extension has been tested and is building successfully.

# Test Strategy:
✅ TESTING COMPLETED: Copy Day target date functionality has been verified as part of Task 13.2 testing. The fix eliminates the July 8 vs July 15 discrepancy previously reported. All test scenarios have been validated: 1) Events copied from July 8 to July 15 now correctly appear on July 15, 2) Cross-month boundary copying works correctly (July 31 to August 1), 3) Multi-day all-day events maintain proper duration on target dates, 4) Time zone handling is consistent, 5) Edge cases including leap years function properly, 6) All-day events follow Google Calendar API standards with proper end date calculation, 7) Enhanced logging provides clear debugging information, 8) API-based copying ensures reliable date targeting without DOM manipulation issues.
