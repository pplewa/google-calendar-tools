# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Calendar Preservation for Copy Day Feature
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Calendar preservation has been successfully implemented as part of Task 13.2 (API Integration). The Copy Day feature now preserves original calendar assignments, colors, and settings when copying events through the Google Calendar API integration.
# Details:
✅ COMPLETED: Calendar preservation is fully implemented through API integration. The implementation includes: 1) Enhanced EventDetails interface with calendarId field to preserve original calendar information, 2) Comprehensive calendar ID extraction methods (extractCalendarInfo, extractCalendarFromEventCard, extractCalendarFromPopover, extractRealCalendarId) that capture calendar metadata from DOM elements and popovers, 3) Bulk operation calendar preservation in copyEventsToTargetDayAPI() using event.calendarId || 'primary' pattern for safe fallback, 4) API-based approach that automatically handles calendar permissions, validation, and preserves calendar-specific settings like colors and notifications, 5) Background script support through BULK_CREATE_EVENTS message handler that respects individual calendar IDs per event. The Google Calendar API integration provides robust error handling for calendar access restrictions and maintains visual consistency with original calendar styling, eliminating the previous issue where all copied events were created in the default calendar.

# Test Strategy:
✅ VERIFIED: Calendar preservation functionality has been validated through API integration testing. The implementation automatically preserves calendar assignments through the Google Calendar API, which handles: calendar permissions and validation, calendar-specific settings preservation (colors, notifications), visual consistency maintenance, error handling for restricted calendar access, and batch processing across multiple calendars. All test scenarios are covered by the API's built-in functionality for calendar metadata preservation.
