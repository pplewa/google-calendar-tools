# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Analytics and Performance Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Add analytics to track feature usage and monitor extension performance.
# Details:
Integrate analytics (e.g., Google Analytics 4 or a lightweight alternative) to track active users and feature usage. Monitor extension load time and impact on browser performance. Use Chrome's performance APIs.

# Test Strategy:
Test that analytics data is collected accurately and performance impact is minimal.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Analytics Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and implement an analytics library suitable for the project (e.g., Google Analytics, Piwik PRO, or Statsig). Install the tracking code or SDK, configure initial settings, and ensure the library is properly initialized within the application.
### Details:
Consider privacy requirements and minimal performance impact during integration. Ensure compatibility with existing tools and platforms. Document the integration process for future maintenance.

## 2. Track Feature Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Define and implement tracking for key feature usage events within the application. Set up event logging for user interactions, such as button clicks, page views, and specific feature activations.
### Details:
Work with stakeholders to identify critical features to track. Use the analytics library's event tracking API to log relevant events. Ensure event names and parameters are consistent and meaningful.

## 3. Monitor Performance with Chrome APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Integrate Chrome performance monitoring APIs to collect metrics such as load times, resource usage, and runtime performance. Send relevant performance data to the analytics platform for analysis.
### Details:
Utilize Chrome's Performance API and related tools to gather metrics. Ensure that performance monitoring does not introduce significant overhead. Correlate performance data with feature usage where possible.

## 4. Validate Data Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Verify that analytics and performance data are being collected accurately and reliably. Perform end-to-end testing to ensure all tracked events and metrics are logged as expected.
### Details:
Review analytics dashboards and raw data exports. Conduct manual and automated tests to simulate user interactions and performance scenarios. Address any discrepancies or data quality issues.
