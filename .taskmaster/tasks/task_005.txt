# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Select and Copy Multiple Events Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow users to select multiple events and copy them to a specified day.
# Details:
Inject checkboxes onto event cards. Add a 'Copy Selected To...' button in the header when events are selected. On click, open a date picker for target day selection. Copy selected events to the chosen day. Use date-fns for date handling. Recommended: date-fns 2.x.

# Test Strategy:
Test that checkboxes appear, button is enabled when events are selected, and events are copied to the target day.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Injecting Checkboxes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add checkboxes to each event in the calendar UI to allow users to select multiple events.
### Details:
Modify the event rendering logic in the calendar component to include a checkbox for each event. Ensure the checkbox is accessible and visually aligned with the event details.

## 2. Managing Selection State [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement state management to track which events have been selected via checkboxes.
### Details:
Use React state (e.g., useState or useReducer) to store the IDs of selected events. Update the state when a checkbox is toggled, and ensure the UI reflects the current selection.

## 3. Adding 'Copy Selected To...' Button [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add a button that initiates the copy process for all currently selected events.
### Details:
Place a 'Copy Selected To...' button in the UI, enabled only when at least one event is selected. Clicking the button should trigger the next step in the workflow.

## 4. Implementing Date Picker [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Integrate a date picker component to allow users to choose the target date for copying events.
### Details:
On clicking the 'Copy Selected To...' button, display a modal or inline date picker (e.g., using Material UI or date-fns) for the user to select the destination date.

## 5. Copying Selected Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement logic to duplicate the selected events to the chosen date.
### Details:
Upon date selection, create new event objects based on the selected events, updating their dates to the chosen target. Update the calendar state to include these new events.

## 6. Testing with date-fns [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Test the entire workflow, ensuring date manipulation and event copying work correctly using date-fns utilities.
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests to verify that events are copied to the correct date, selection state is managed properly, and the UI updates as expected. Use date-fns for all date calculations.
